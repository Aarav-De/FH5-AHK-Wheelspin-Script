# FH5-AHK-Wheelspin-Script
Automatically opens super wheelspins in Forza Horizon 5 without collecting duplicate cars. All duplicates are sold.

PgUp to toggle the macro
PgDn to close the macro completely

The script may collect a duplicate car in its first spins but will continue on the proper timings to sell all other cars if there are duplicates. 

Can run for multiple hours without filling up inventory provided you have enough wheelspins.
